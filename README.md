# Project Name: Mutual Authentication Demo

## Overview

This project serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to showcase the implementation of a client/server architecture for mutual authentication. The demonstration involves utilizing the `commons-net` library for the client and the `org.apache.ftpserver` library for the server.

There are a couple of tests that demonstrate a positive mTls connection, and the negative tests that breaks when the certificates are not well provided.

## Requirements 

- Java JDK (version 17 or higher)
- Maven (for building and managing dependencies)
